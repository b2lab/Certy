# Certy

Certy is the application that allows you to certify Digital Contents of any extension on the Ethereum Blockchain. You can create an immutable record by notarising any kind of file (Pdf, images, projects, music, video etc) in a tamperproof way on the Blockchain. After notifying your content, Certy will issue a document that represents the immutable record stored in the database managed by smart contract that ensures the successful certification with these details:

* Encripted fingerprint of your digital content
* Address of your wallet
* Memo label
* Hash of the related transaction
* Timestamp

Then, through Smart Contract, Certy allows you to easily and automatically check the compliance of a Content with the Certified Original. Just entering the public key of the certifier wallet and the content to verify. Certy automatically makes the comparison of the fingerprint on the database managed on Blockchain by the Smart Contract and returns the result, this verification is fully automated and not manually as other similar applications do.

Certy is addressed to national and international audience, it can be used by different categories of users as Certificators, Auditors, Notaries, Lawyers, etc.
Reasons why are many and important, for example to ensure on the Blockchain that a digital content was in possession of a specific figure or entity at a given time (Proof of existence) or to ensure that digital content verification is in compliance with the original content notarized by the certifier.


## What is the Certyâ€™s added value?

A smart contract that manage the certification of a digital content and its owner address called certifier and automatically check for the compliance with an original one notarized by that certifier.

Certy also provides a tool to verify the compliance of a content to the certified original version, because the data stored in smart contracts are fully verifiable and unalterable over time.

## Prerequisites:

* Mozilla Firefox browser or Google Chrome
* Metamask installed, a digital ethereum wallet.
You will need to put ether into it in order to certify digital content.

## Please Note:

* In order to notarize your content forever in the Ethereum Mainnet, Certify Content function will send a fee of 0.001 Eth to a B2Lab wallet, Check Content and Content List are free.
